## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Universal global skills `/simplify` and `/batch`**: two bundled, domain-agnostic slash commands available in desktop and gateway channels. `/simplify` targets quality simplification passes; `/batch` targets parallelizable migration/transform workflows across code, research, writing, operations, and general tasks.
- **Inline slash chaining**: normal messages can now chain workflow execution with patterns like `... then run /simplify` or `... then run /batch ...` in the same task context.
- **Shared slash parser/normalizer**: centralized parsing in `src/shared/skill-slash-commands.ts` for direct slash commands and inline chains, with URL/path false-positive protection and robust flag validation.
- **DuckDuckGo free search fallback**: built-in web search provider that requires no API key. Works out of the box by scraping DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint. Automatically used as a last-resort fallback when paid providers fail or are not configured. The `web_search` tool is now always available — users no longer need to configure a search provider to use web search.
- **Polymarket prediction market skill**: query odds, trending markets, price momentum, orderbook depth, open interest, trade history, and resolution timelines across Gamma, CLOB, and Data APIs — no authentication required. Includes formatted output with percentages, volume breakdowns, and multi-outcome event support.
- **Humanizer writing skill**: rewrite AI-generated text to sound natural and human-written. Detects and removes 50+ LLM tells across 7 layers — vocabulary, sentence mechanics, paragraph structure, emotional register, content depth, document architecture, and tone. Includes flagged word lists, 6 tone presets, and a systematic 7-step rewriting process.
- **YouTube video intelligence skill**: fetch transcripts, metadata, chapters, and captions from YouTube videos via yt-dlp or youtube-transcript-api. Supports auto-generated and manual captions, multi-language, translation, audio extraction, playlists, and timestamp deep links. Includes 6 workflow recipes.
- **Stock analysis skill**: comprehensive market intelligence across 3 data sources (Yahoo Finance API, yfinance, Alpha Vantage). Covers real-time quotes, 60+ fundamental metrics, 50+ technical indicators, financial statements, earnings, options chains, analyst ratings, institutional holders, dividends, stock screening, and an 8-dimensional scoring framework.
- **Calendly scheduling skill**: manage Calendly via the v2 API. Covers event types, scheduled events, invitees with custom Q&A, availability and busy times, cancellation, no-show management, one-off booking links, webhooks, and organization members. Includes 8 workflow recipes and timezone-aware agenda formatting.
- **Moltbook agent social network skill**: interact with Moltbook — the social network for AI agents. Post content, reply to discussions, browse feeds, upvote/downvote, join submolt communities, follow agents, search semantically, and track engagement. Includes agent registration, verification challenges, and formatted feed output.
- **Marketing Strategist skill**: comprehensive marketing strategy across 25 disciplines — positioning, buyer psychology, copywriting frameworks (PAS, AIDA, BAB, 4Ps, FAB), SEO, landing page CRO, paid ads (Google/Meta/LinkedIn), funnel architecture, analytics, pricing, product launches, growth loops, competitive intelligence, and marketing operations. Includes 8 workflow recipes and integrates with existing channel-specific skills.
- **Completion output summary payload**: `task_completed` now supports optional `outputSummary` metadata (`created`, `modifiedFallback`, `primaryOutputPath`, `outputCount`, `folders`) so output-aware UI remains accurate beyond capped event history.
- **Action-oriented completion UX**: completion toasts now surface output filename/count and include direct actions for opening the file, revealing in Finder, or jumping to the Files panel.
- **Artifact parity across output UX**: `artifact_created` is now treated as a first-class output signal in renderer output derivation, collaborative child-event merge, and control-plane event bridging.
- **Renderer completion UX helper layer**: shared utilities now centralize output-derivation fallback, completion attention rules, and panel/badge behavior for deterministic testing.

### Changed
- **Gateway routing for slash skills**: `/simplify` and `/batch` now have first-class command handlers with usage/help responses on invalid input, while forwarding normalized command text to desktop executor as the single execution source of truth.
- **Desktop composer slash pass-through**: Enter/Tab no longer auto-select slash dropdown entries when input is an exact `/simplify...` or `/batch...` invocation, preserving direct command send behavior.
- **Help and channel UX text**: compact/full command help now includes `/simplify` and `/batch`; WhatsApp natural phrase normalization maps common simplify/batch phrases to slash commands.
- **Output detection precedence**: output detection now prefers created outputs and only uses modified outputs as fallback when no created outputs are detected.
- **Right-panel files UX**: Files rows remain filename-only, with a primary output highlight, output count badge, and an explicit location context line (folder or “Workspace root”).
- **Timeline completion details**: `task_completed` now shows an “Output ready” detail card with `Open file`, `Show in Finder`, and `View in Files` actions when outputs are present.
- **Task status mapping consistency**: `artifact_created` now maps to `executing` in shared status mapping to keep progress indicators coherent.

### Fixed
- **Inline chain punctuation handling**: chaining now recognizes punctuation-terminated forms (for example, `then run /simplify.`) instead of silently skipping.
- **`/batch` objective enforcement**: parser and docs now enforce required objective semantics for `/batch <objective>`.
- **`/batch` external-effects guardrails**: runtime policy enforcement now supports deterministic blocking/approval behavior:
  - `external=none` blocks known side-effect external tool calls for the run.
  - `external=confirm` requires explicit non-auto approval before first side-effect external action.
- **Slash parser freeform objective edge cases**: objective parsing now supports quoted text and `--token`-like content inside objectives without misclassifying them as unknown flags.
- **Files list filtering edge case**: extensionless output files are no longer excluded from the right panel.
- **Executor hard budget contracts are now opt-in**: `COWORK_AGENT_BUDGET_CONTRACTS` defaults to `false` (previously `true`). Set `COWORK_AGENT_BUDGET_CONTRACTS=true` to restore legacy strict budget-contract behavior.

## [0.3.90] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Tasks can run in isolated git worktrees with automatic branch creation (`cowork/<task-slug>`), auto-commit, merge back to base branch, conflict detection, and worktree cleanup after completion.
- **Collaborative Mode**: Auto-create ephemeral multi-agent teams for a task. Multiple agents work in parallel, sharing their analysis and reasoning in real-time via the Collaborative Thoughts Panel, with a leader agent synthesizing the final result.
- **Multi-LLM Mode**: Send the same task to multiple LLM providers/models simultaneously. A judge agent synthesizes the best result from all participants. Configure participants and judge via the Multi-LLM Selection Panel.
- **Agent Comparison Mode**: Run the same task across different agents or models side by side using the ComparisonService. View results in a dedicated comparison UI with diff viewer.
- **Task Pinning**: Pin/unpin tasks in the sidebar for quick access. Pinned tasks always appear at the top regardless of sort order. Toggle via context menu or keyboard shortcut.
- **Wrap-Up Task**: Gracefully wrap up running tasks instead of hard-cancelling. The agent finishes its current thought and produces a summary before stopping. Available for both individual tasks and team runs.
- **Git Tools**: New agent tools for git operations — `git_commit`, `git_diff`, and `git_branch` — with worktree-aware execution for isolated task environments.
- **Capability Matcher**: Auto-select the best agents for a task based on capability matching against agent role skills and the task requirements.
- **Collaborative Thoughts Panel**: Real-time UI component showing agent thinking, analysis, and synthesis during collaborative and multi-LLM mode runs. Includes phase indicators and streaming thought bubbles.
- **Scroll-to-bottom button**: Floating button in task view for quick navigation to the latest events.
- **VPS uninstall documentation**: Added uninstall/removal instructions for VPS deployments covering both partial (keep data) and full (irreversible) paths for Docker and systemd setups.
- **New skill packs**: Crypto Trading, Crypto Execution, Trading Foundation, and Email Marketing Bible skill definitions with scripts and tests.
- **XLSX file support**: Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx/.xls) can now be read and extracted as tab-separated text in the file viewer, with formula result, rich text, and date support.
- **Attachment chips in chat bubbles**: user message bubbles render compact file-attachment chips instead of raw file-path listings.
- **Varied failure loop detection**: executor detects when a tool fails 5+ times with different inputs and nudges the agent to switch strategy.

### Changed
- **Executor modular refactoring**: TaskExecutor split into dedicated utility modules — completion logic, canvas rendering, prompt heuristics, tool execution, loop management, LLM turn handling, assistant output processing, and workspace preflight checks. New ExecutorEventEmitter and LifecycleMutex for cleaner concurrency control.
- **Task event bridge contract**: Inline event type allowlist extracted from control-plane handlers into a shared `task-event-bridge-contract` module, making it reusable and testable.
- **Task event status map**: Inline status mapping extracted to a shared `task-event-status-map` module used by both renderer and control plane.
- **Agent team orchestrator**: Extended with collaborative mode phases, thought capture, wrap-up support, multi-LLM synthesis, and run phase tracking.
- **Database schema**: Added `is_pinned` column to tasks, `agent_team_thoughts` table, `phase`/`collaborative_mode`/`multi_llm_mode` columns to agent_team_runs, worktree and comparison_session tables.
- **Document creation defaults**: Markdown (.md) is now the preferred output format; `create_document` (DOCX/PDF) only triggers on explicit user request.
- **Hooks auto-token**: enabled hooks server auto-generates a missing authentication token instead of silently disabling.
- **Reduced startup log noise**: zero-count messages for plugins, canvas sessions, and legacy settings are suppressed; MCP stderr demoted to debug.
- **Slack Socket Mode timeouts**: relaxed ping/pong timeouts (15s/60s) to reduce reconnection churn on unstable networks.

### Fixed
- **Stuck 'executing' status**: tasks can no longer remain in `executing` state after follow-ups — safety nets ensure completed or restored status.
- **User identity leakage**: personality prompt now explicitly instructs the LLM to ignore names from file paths, filenames, and OS metadata when a preferred name is stored.
- **WhatsApp connection flap detection**: rapid disconnect/reconnect cycles are detected and throttled with enforced backoff.
- **Artifact false positives**: attachment filenames (e.g. "26targets.xlsx") no longer falsely trigger document-creation mode; read-only steps skip artifact output requirement.
- **Collapsible user bubble toggle**: shows both "Show more" and "Show less" (previously button disappeared after expanding).
- **Daemon shutdown task persistence**: active tasks are marked cancelled in DB before executor cancellation to prevent orphaned-task detection on restart.

## [0.3.86] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **ACP and Canvas control-plane endpoints**: introduced ACP task-delegation handlers and new canvas APIs (`canvas.list/get/snapshot/content/push/eval/checkpoint.*`) with corresponding protocol constants and IPC wiring.
- **Canvas checkpoint tooling**: added `canvas_checkpoint`, `canvas_restore`, and `canvas_checkpoints` tools, plus in-memory checkpoint history and restore flows in `CanvasManager`.
- **Renderer i18n support**: added language resources and UI selection for English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese, with persisted language preference.
- **Talk Mode UX**: introduced continuous voice talk-mode hook and UI controls for conversational voice interaction in main task view.

### Changed
- **Agent execution flow hardening**: executor now emits long-running tool heartbeats, tracks recovered failures more precisely, and preflights shell-permission requirements when command execution is required.
- **Shell approvals and safety**: `run_command` now supports single-approval bundle mode for safe command sequences and normalizes signatures more robustly for duplicate detection.
- **Gateway routing extensibility**: router now supports channel-level `defaultAgentRoleId`, `defaultWorkspaceId`, and `allowedAgentRoleIds`, plus new `set_agent` router-rule action.
- **Skill registry backend**: default registry now points to GitHub static catalog mode with client-side cached search and static skill fetch/install paths.
- **Plugin discovery behavior**: plugin registry initializes at startup and supports incremental discovery of newly-added plugins without full re-init.

### Fixed
- **Sensitive shell output leakage**: command output now redacts seed phrases and private-key material before logging/model context.
- **Isolated macOS install keychain prompt safety**: added `COWORK_DISABLE_OS_KEYCHAIN=1` path to bypass OS keychain integration in disposable test environments.
- **Task activity signaling in UI**: task “working” indicators now consider tool calls/results and tool-execution progress heartbeats, reducing false idle states.
- **Install reliability carry-forward**: retains prior setup retry behavior and low-memory setup defaults while validating clean first-install flow.

## [0.3.85] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Hoisted Electron detection in setup**: `npm run setup` now treats `../electron` as valid in npm-hoisted installs, so first-time setup no longer triggers unnecessary full dependency bootstrap.
- **Native setup install scope**: missing `better-sqlite3` recovery and rebuild now run from the actual install root (not inside `node_modules/cowork-os`), reducing first-run reify pressure that caused frequent macOS `SIGKILL`.
- **Release publish gating**: npm/GitHub package publish jobs now depend on the release validation job, and smoke tests fail if setup unexpectedly falls back to dependency bootstrap.
- **Install docs hardening**: README now includes a direct native retry-wrapper fallback when `npm run --prefix node_modules/cowork-os setup` is terminated by `zsh: killed`, and recommends local bin launch over `npx` for first run.

## [0.3.84] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release smoke-test module resolution**: installability validation now runs Electron with `cwd` set to the installed `cowork-os` package directory so `require('better-sqlite3')` resolves correctly after setup.
- **Release continuity**: keeps the 0.3.82 npm SIGKILL regression fix while restoring end-to-end GitHub release packaging path after CI validation.

## [0.3.83] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release workflow syntax fix**: corrected the installability smoke-test shell step so the release pipeline no longer exits with `syntax error: unexpected end of file` before desktop packaging.
- **Release continuity**: preserves the 0.3.82 npm SIGKILL fix while restoring full GitHub release asset publishing (DMG/ZIP).

## [0.3.82] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **SIGKILL regression fix for npm installs**: `setup_native` no longer uses `npm install --ignore-scripts=false` when recovering missing `better-sqlite3`, preventing `electron-winstaller` lifecycle scripts from being executed during first-time setup.
- **Recovery install hardening**: missing runtime dependency repair now uses `--omit=dev` and `--package-lock=false` to avoid reifying packaging/dev dependency trees in user runtime installs.

## [0.3.81] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **README install path hardening**: `npm run setup` now skips a full dependency reinstall when the Electron dependency is already present, so fresh `/tmp` installs avoid avoidable reinstall-driven SIGKILL pressure.
- **Native setup reliability**: restores the 0.3.71-style flow with retryable native setup and keeps `better-sqlite3` installation script-safe, then rebuilds it explicitly against Electron ABI.

## [0.3.80] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **macOS install reliability hardening**: setup now skips optional dependency reinstall during `npm run setup`, avoids propagating child SIGKILL events from native setup back to the shell, and documents a first-install flow that avoids macOS-terminating paths.
- **Release validation hardening**: CI now resolves release metadata before install validation and validates installability from either published npm tarball (if already published) or local `npm pack` fallback, preventing release regressions for first-release tags.

## [0.3.79] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **macOS install reliability carry-forward**: retained the 0.3.71 SIGKILL workaround for first-time users by documenting and reinforcing the `npm install --ignore-scripts` + `npm run --prefix node_modules/cowork-os setup` flow.
- **Release workflow hardening**: ensured the macOS release job always creates or reopens the GitHub release as a draft before packaging so `electron-builder` can attach DMG/zip assets without immutable-release failures.
- **Version alignment**: published metadata now identifies this release as `0.3.79` with the same installability and packaging reliability changes.

## [0.3.78] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release build hardening**: restored the missing `src/electron/agent/executor-helpers.ts` source file so builds can resolve `executor.ts` imports after packaging from a fresh clone.
- **TypeScript strictness fixes**: fixed implicit `any` errors in `executor.ts` that could break release builds on CI.
- **TLS fingerprint callback typing fix**: aligned `remote-client.ts` callback signature/type usage with current `ws` client typings to satisfy strict build checks.

## [0.3.77] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Setup script safety**: `npm run setup` in a fresh install now runs dependency reinstall with `--ignore-scripts` so optional postinstall hooks like `electron-winstaller` cannot SIGKILL the process during first-run recovery on macOS.
- **Install reliability carry-forward**: this patch keeps the documented `/tmp` first-install sequence intact while ensuring setup stays stable across npm install layouts.
- **Version alignment**: published metadata is now aligned on `0.3.77` so the installability fix is included in both npm and GitHub release tracks.

## [0.3.76] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Installability restoration**: pinned `electron` to `40.2.1` so first-time installs from `npm` pull the known-good Electron patch and avoid `SIGKILL` during `node_modules/electron/install.js` on affected macOS environments.
- **README alignment**: clarified the first-time CLI install path to reflect the exact commands users should run from a fresh temporary folder.

## [0.3.75] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Installability fix from 0.3.71**: restored Electron lockfile behavior by keeping `electron` at `40.2.1` during publish-time installs, matching the working `0.3.71` state and avoiding default `SIGKILL` during `node_modules/electron/install.js` on affected installs.

## [0.3.74] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release pipeline reliability**: updated the GitHub release publish step to find and publish the tag created by `electron-builder` instead of assuming the trigger ref matches exactly.
- **Release docs/notes alignment**: updated release notes and README "What’s new" section for `0.3.74` to reflect install and CI reliability fixes.
- **Release artifact consistency**: ensured workflow publishes desktop artifacts and release notes from the same release tag path used by electron packaging.

## [0.3.73] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Release pipeline fix**: included daemon TypeScript sources in shared ESLint targets so `npm run lint` runs instead of failing with parse errors before build/publish steps.
- **Workspace/task validation fix**: enforced `PersonalityId` validation for task agent configs to prevent runtime/inference mismatches during task creation.
- **CLI and release install tests alignment**: updated control-plane and skill validation tests to match current runtime behaviors and skill metadata output.
- **Workspace preflight reliability**: stabilized ambiguous temp-task auto-switch behavior when project-signals are present and tests now validate that behavior.

## [0.3.72] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Session workspace isolation and cleanup**: temp tasks now get session-scoped workspace IDs, dedicated temp directories, and automatic pruning by age + usage caps.
- **Autonomous task mode** in execution flow and control-plane/web-UI paths, with optional bypass of interactive approval prompts where explicitly enabled.
- **Companion-mode handling for short conversational prompts** to return concise check-in responses without running task pipeline when appropriate.
- **Search execution ordering** now prefers Brave when available and can safely fallback through configured providers automatically.
- **PDF parsing compatibility wrapper** with runtime-safe handling for both legacy and v2 parser module shapes.

### Changed
- **Task completion validation tightened** with final-response contracts (required direct answers, artifact checks, verification evidence).
- **Stricter tool failure handling** for hard/unavailable/disallowed outcomes to prevent false completion without real progress.
- **Temporary workspace handling** now uses explicit session-aware IDs and filters temp workspaces from user-visible lists consistently.
- **Search and file tools** now enforce more bounded scanning behavior and clearer fallback behavior under high-load conditions.

### Fixed
- **Watch/skip recommendation tasks** now block artifact tools and require direct recommendation output.
- **Intermittent approval/partial-task updates** reduced by normalizing auto-approved events in UI and task-stream handling.
- **Temp workspace lifecycle reliability** improved through scheduled pruning and safer restore/create paths.

## [0.3.69] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `npm install -g cowork-os` could fail on macOS with `fsevents` (`binding.gyp not found`) due an npm 11 rebuild edge case triggered by `playwright`.
- Switched runtime browser dependency to `playwright-core` via npm alias (`playwright` package name preserved in code) to avoid the failing `fsevents` install path.
- Added launcher self-heal: on first run, `cowork-os` now verifies direct runtime dependencies and repairs missing packages with a script-free npm install pass before boot.
- Moved `@types/jszip` to `devDependencies` and excluded `@types/*` from runtime dependency checks to avoid unnecessary first-run repair installs.
- Moved `@electron/rebuild` to runtime dependencies so native fallback rebuild works in npm-installed environments.
- Fixed native setup fallback to locate `@electron/rebuild` via package exports (instead of resolving blocked subpaths), so fallback rebuild actually runs when needed.
- `cowork-os` first run now uses the shell retry wrapper for native setup, reducing one-shot startup failures when macOS kills a setup attempt under memory pressure.

## [0.3.68] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `cowork-os` CLI startup could still fail with `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch on first launch.
- Launcher now validates `better-sqlite3` by opening an in-memory database (not just requiring the module) and runs native setup when needed.
- Native setup script now resolves hoisted dependencies correctly (Electron and `better-sqlite3`) so it works in npm-installed layouts.

## [0.3.67] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Added npm CLI command support: `cowork-os`, `coworkctl`, `coworkd`, and `coworkd-node`.

### Fixed
- Fixed launcher script to resolve the Electron binary correctly (`require('electron')` instead of `require.resolve`).
- Included `dist/` in published npm files so the `cowork-os` command can start without requiring a local build step.
- Moved `electron` to runtime dependencies so CLI launch works after normal npm install.

## [0.3.66] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- `npm ci` could hang indefinitely in CI due an `overrides.undici` resolution loop on npm 11.
- Removed the `undici` override so release and publish jobs can complete.

## [0.3.65] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm publishing no longer waits for the macOS packaging job in `release.yml`.
- This prevents npm release delays when GitHub macOS runners are stalled while still allowing desktop packaging to run independently.

## [0.3.64] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Release workflow could stall for a long time at `Install dependencies` when git-based dependencies attempted SSH transport on GitHub runners.
- CI now forces GitHub git dependencies to HTTPS before `npm ci` in all release/publish jobs.
- Added explicit workflow timeouts and `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` to reduce long-running hangs during release.

## [0.3.63] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could still fail with `SIGKILL` in transitive `protobufjs` postinstall hooks under macOS memory pressure.
- Bundled `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and `@whiskeysockets/baileys` in the published npm tarball so their transitive install scripts are not executed on end-user `npm install`.
- Restricted published package contents via `files` in `package.json` to remove large non-runtime artifacts and reduce install-time memory pressure.

## [0.3.62] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could still fail when the package `postinstall` script itself was SIGKILL'd by macOS memory pressure.
- Removed `postinstall` from the published npm package so `npm install cowork-os@latest` no longer depends on any CoWork lifecycle hook.

## [0.3.61] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could fail with `sh: electron-rebuild: command not found` because `postinstall` depended on a tool not available in all install contexts.
- `postinstall` now uses a best-effort native setup driver and never fails the overall npm install.
- `better-sqlite3` is now an optional dependency so transient native build failures no longer abort `npm install`; `npm run setup` now ensures it is installed before rebuild.

## [0.3.60] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- npm installs could fail on macOS with `Killed: 9` during dependency lifecycle scripts due to floating dependency upgrades.
- Pinned `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to `6.7.16` and `better-sqlite3` to `12.6.2` to avoid pulling newer variants that increased install-time instability.

## [0.3.59] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- Increased default native setup outer retry attempts on macOS so `npm run setup` is more resilient to repeated transient `Killed: 9` SIGKILLs on the first run after install.

## [0.3.58] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the native setup retry wrapper itself was SIGKILL’d immediately after install; setup now performs outer retries (with backoff) around native setup so a transient SIGKILL doesn’t require manual re-runs.

## [0.3.57] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if the nested `npm run setup:native` process was SIGKILL’d; setup now runs the native setup retry wrapper directly (no nested npm process) and propagates SIGKILL as exit code 137 so retries reliably trigger.

## [0.3.56] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` if macOS SIGKILL’d Node before in-process retries could run; native setup now uses a POSIX shell retry wrapper with exponential backoff so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.55] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` before the retry driver could start; setup now retries native setup at the shell level (multiple attempts) so users don’t need to re-run commands manually.

## [0.3.54] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9` on the first run under memory pressure; native setup now runs via a retrying driver and `setup` disables npm audit/fund to reduce peak memory usage.

## [0.3.53] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could still fail with `Killed: 9`; native setup now prefers an Electron-targeted `better-sqlite3` rebuild via `npm rebuild` (often uses prebuilds) and only falls back to `electron-rebuild` when necessary.

## [0.3.52] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- macOS `npm run setup` could fail with `Killed: 9` during native module rebuild; native setup now defaults to low parallelism for reliability.

## [0.3.29] - 2025-02-08
